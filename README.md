# portfolio
Look at my portfolio felt I wasn't satisfied with it so I think I will do a complete overhaul


## TODOS:
* Decide if I want to proceed with React on this customized protfolio page. (90% yes)
* Get an idea how I want to structure the page and where stuff like Bio, Projects, Qualifications, Skills, etc. should be.
* Make everything all one page where its just scrolling down or divide it into "separate" pages via React router
* Look into implementing some advanced CSS and look into SASS
* Consider also looking into Material UI
* Make sure its all mobile responsive and stuff.
* Pick a color scheme that I'll be happy with and that matches portfolio page.
* Actually make an effort to throw in a professional pic of myself.
* Have something I can look at and be proud of.
